Debian or Ubuntu
================

If you prefer standard Debian or Ubuntu packages, you can create them by running the script `debianize.sh`.

Since this script installs some extra packages, you should run it in a virtual machine: for example you can use the Vagrant file.
Both Python3 and Python2 packages are generated.
